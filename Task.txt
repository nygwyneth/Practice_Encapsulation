JAVA ENCAPSULATION

Create 2 Java Classes:
    Main.java
    Card.java 

In Main.java, user can perform the following:
    1) User can check the card information (Balance and Card Number) - DONE
    2) User can add balance to their Card
    3) User can withdraw money using their card
        - If the amount to withdraw < remaining balance
        - The amount to withdraw should be divisible by 100

In Card.java, you should apply encapsulation approach (Getters and Setters)
    1) setBalance
    2) getBalance
    3) withdrawMoney

Note: All variable should be set to private and use a constructor in Card class 
    to set a default balance and random card number to the user card.
